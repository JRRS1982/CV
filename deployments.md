# Projects

Here is a curated list of some of the work I have deployed / plan to do.

## Projects Deployed

- [x] [jeremysmith.co.uk](https://www.jeremysmith.co.uk/) A templated SPA gatsby markdown site, hosted on AWS Amplify, MVP. Code is [here](https://github.com/JRRS1982/gatsby-portfolio), but currently private as required very little work. 

## Future Plans

I own some fun domains, and plan to use them to build projects for fun and to skill up.

- [ ] [balanced.money](https://www.balanced.money/) This will be a React / Node fullstack application - handling numbers, dates, tables, auth and security. Keen to include balance sheet, cash flow, transaction and investment return pages in the frontend and a seperate API graphql backend.
- [ ] [dough.pizza](https://www.dough.pizza/) This will be a React / Node fullstack application - probably with adverts for pizza shops / links to equipment and a guide on how to make a good pizza at home. An experiment with embeding adverts.
- [ ] [castleshare.org](https://www.castleshare.org/) This will be a React / Node fullstack application - probably social orientated with users, groups and comments and maybe some use of Google maps and OAuth?
- [ ] [our.auction](https://www.our.auction/) This will be a React / Node fullstack application - probably an auction site along the lines of eBay, dealing with times and categories.
- [ ] [jeremysmith.co.uk](https://www.jeremysmith.co.uk/) Keen to not be using a template.
