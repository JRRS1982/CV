### MVF Global (October 2019 - Present)

#### *Associate Software Engineer*

Since October 2020 I have been building Typescript, Node and MySQL S2S services, which are Dockerised, deployed via Circleci and have Jest test coverage.

My first 12 months at MVF consisted of rotating 50/50 between building APIs for stakeholders using Postman and our proprietary service and working on a legacy PHP/Laravel monolith.

I have planned, written up and completed my own JIRA stories and contributed to the weekly architecture meetings. I have worked across approx 40 micro-services and monoliths. 

I have worked with varying amounts of Typescript, React, Node, MySQL, GraphQL, Javascript, PHP, Laravel, CodeIgniter, Travis, CircleCi, AWS, Jest, PHPUnit, Docker, Ruby, Jira, Trello, Postman, Snowflake, Looker, VsCode, PHPStorm. I work on a Mac at home and Linux at work, and have used various other associated packages / libraries.
