I am a London based self-taught and motivated software engineer, currently developing my technical knowledge and skill
after graduating from the Makers Academy software engineering bootcamp.

I am ***motivated to keep learning*** and love sharing to hold myself accoutable and to document industry best practice,
therefore [here](https://www.notion.so/Best-Practice-Language-notes-3a8dfb1bec6c49f0987d5dd5a544c18b) I have made public
 some of my working notes on various languages and some useful resources.

My interest in IT has always been present, I played with circuit boards at sixth form, and went to Farnboough College in
2001 to learn to code, but my career took another path and I spent 10 years in property followed by five in finance.
While I picked up a lot of transferable skills during this time I did not believe in what I was doing, I enjoyed problem
solving in these roles and have always been the 'IT' guy, an expert in excel formula or the person responsible for
improving processes / databases / aware of shortcuts.
