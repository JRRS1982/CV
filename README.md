# Jeremy Smith

I’m a software engineer with a genuine passion for building applications. I’ve worked with technologies like React, Node.js, Redux, and TypeScript to create user-friendly experiences and solve real problems.

## Professional Experience

### MVF Global (October 2019 - Present)

#### Software Engineer

**July 2024 - Present**

- I led the creation of a feature in our lead generation app that allows customers to book appointments at the point that they submit their information. This involved crafting an iframe that preloaded data and was conditionally rendered in the app dynamically (mid transition in a carousel), which presented a way for a CRO (conversion rate optimization) team to experiment independently within a closed and secure production application.
- I take pride in mentoring junior engineers, helping them grow, and supporting mid-level and senior colleagues. I also work closely with product managers and designers to align on project goals, ensuring everyone is on the same page.
- Coaching junior staff is a regular part of my work, and I find it rewarding to see their progress.

**November 2021 - Present**

- I’ve built a set of microservices that are dockerised and deployed via CircleCI. I ensure we log errors with Datadog and maintain thorough unit tests with Jest. I have some experience in working with Selenium, in the E2E suite.
- Developed a React-Typescript component library using Storybook, which we’ve published to npm for easy use.
- Addressed performance issues related to excessive re-rendering and I successfully transitioned our global state management to Redux, which has improved our application’s responsiveness.
- I also contributed to enhancing a legacy PHP/Laravel application and presented findings at tech guilds on topics that matter to our team.

**October 2020 - November 2021**

- Worked on server-to-server (marketing automation) microservices and APIs that help us manage costs and revenue across platforms like Facebook and Google. This experience deepened my understanding of how different systems interact.

**October 2019 - October 2020**

- Developed APIs for our internal systems and provided user support on our CRM. I learned some PHP/Laravel during this time, which helped me appreciate the nuances of working with legacy systems.

### Makers Academy Bootcamp (Feb - May 2019)

I attended a bootcamp that helped me build a solid foundation in coding and collaborative practices, including Git, pair programming, and test-driven development. This was a transformative experience for me.

### Prior Experience

Before diving into software engineering, I spent time in finance and property management, where I supported financial advisors and managed property. This background taught me the importance of detail and communication.
