Each page linked below and its nested sub pages have been created to support my development and evidence what I have 
learnt so far for a potential employer by demonstrating those skills and abilities that are commonly 
required as a software engineer. They also serve as a personal reflection of what i have learnt so far to help against 
imposter sydrome and assist in my goal / learning setting for the future.

In addition to this, I am keen to learn / share industry best practice and write good quality code, therefore below I
have made public some of my notes on best practice and languages which I am going to continue to add to as I get more 
experience.
