Software engineer, with experience working in Typescript, Node, React and writing clean code.

## Experience

### MVF Global (October 2019 - Present)

## *Software Engineer from July 2021*

Since October 2021 I have been building React components in Storybook with TS, and building the lead generation widget which uses those components, and an associated loader application - which embeds the widget on a clients website, within an iFrame.

From October 2020 until October 2021 I was building Typescript, Node and MySQL S2S applications. These services are are Dockerised, deployed via CircleCi, log errors to Datadog and have Jest test coverage. They send and receive data to global marketing / advertising platforms.

I have worked with varying amounts of Typescript, React, Node, MySQL, GraphQL, Javascript, PHP, Laravel, CodeIgniter, Travis, CircleCi, AWS, Jest, PHPUnit, Docker, Ruby, Jira, Trello, Postman, Snowflake, Datadog, Looker, VsCode, PHPStorm. I used to work on a Mac, but given I work on Dockerised applications I use Linux and have a preference to continue working in JS/TS.

#### *Associate Software Engineer*

The first 12 months at MVF consisted of rotating 50/50 between building APIs and interacting with internal stakeholders to debug apis and learning PHP by maintaining a legacy PHP monolith. Since Oct 2020 I have been building Typescript and Node S2S applications.
