**My Work at MVF:** In my time at MVF I have pivoted across over 40 projects in different languages and moved teams, so I have had some experience in Typescript, React, Redux, Node, MySql, GraphQL, PHP, Laravel and CodeIgniter along with associated packages. Some of the projects had Jest and PHPUnit test suites, some did not. I have some exposure to logging errors to Datadog, crons in Jenkins, deployment on CircleCi, Docker containers / volumes and have used both Mac and Linux machines for work. Currently I am building S2S micro-services with Typescript and Node.

**My Coding Background:** I started learning to code seriously in 2018 and took a coding bootcamp in Feb 2019 to fast track my career change. After getting a job as a full stack associate software engineer at MVF I have been learning as much as I possibly can to get things done at work. Shifting context a lot has meant that I have built a shallow but fairly broad range of experience across multiple languages, frameworks and services.
