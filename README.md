# CV: Jeremy Smith

A software engineer, with experience of working with React, Node, Redux, GraphQl, Typescript, Storybook, Next.js, Jest and some Docker / AWS / Datadog.

## Professional Experience

### Software Engineer at MVF Global (October 2019 - Present)

- **November 2021 - Current**: creating a series of microservices which are dockerised, deployed via circleci, log errors to datadog and have good jest, unit test coverage.
  - I personally investigated an issue with excessive re-rendering of our main application, found the cause was due to a global context, proposed the solution (redux with Immer slices), and managed the epic of migrating the whole application's state to Redux.
  - I personally presented at the companies tech guild on the merits of Redux over context in this case and on a separate occasion, on React performance improvement, one way was through the use of self contained components and co-locating state.
  - I personally created a large number of React / TS components for the Storybook library and stories for users to test them.
  - built and tested a React-Typescript component library in Storybook, which is published to npm.
  - built and tested an embeddable JS widget in an iframe, with responsive height to the parent container and transition effects between renders to show enter/exit of unloaded pages.
  - build a generator application, which had UI buttons to create a snippet, that is used for embedding the widget.
  - built gateway applications for the widget and the generator: node + TS.

- **October 2020 - November 2021**: built and tested server to server microservice's / API's, which sent revenue and read costs from marketing platforms. TS, Node, Express, Apollo, Jest, MySQL, Snowflake, Looker, Postman.

- **October 2019 - October 2020**: built and tested API's on an internal API system, provided user support on an internal CRM platform, learnt basic PHP while adding features such as a subcategory page to a legacy monolith.

### Makers Academy Bootcamp Feb-May 2019

I became increasingly interested in learning to code in 2018, and spent a lot of time on freecodecamp. I then chose to attend a bootcamp to get assistance entering the job market, they taught us:

Git, pair programming, jira, TDD, SOLID, Kanban, Ruby, Rspec, Cucumber, MVC, Rails, CI, Travis, REST, CD, Heroku, UML, debugging strategies.

#### Prior to software

I liked the idea of working in finance, and spend 4.5 years working in financial advice, supporting advisors with the technical paperwork and calculating investment returns.

Prior to that I spent about 8 years exploring roles in property, valuing property, managing estates of houses / flats, inspecting damage and managing budgets. In circa 2007-2009 I studied Real Estate at Kingston Uni and obtained a post graduate diploma.
