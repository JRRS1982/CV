I am a London based **hard working** software engineer, currently learning as much as I can after graduation from the Makers Academy software development bootcamp.

I am **motivated** to keep learning and love the openness of the industry in sharing best practice to improve each other, therefore [here](https://www.notion.so/Best-Practice-Language-notes-3a8dfb1bec6c49f0987d5dd5a544c18b) I have made public some of my working notes on various languages and some useful resources.

My interest in IT has always been present, I played with circuit boards at sixth form, and went to Farnborough College in 2001 to study Coding (Business and IT), but I changed courses and my career took another direction. I have spent 10 years in property followed by five in finance.

While I picked up many transferable skills during the first half of my career I did not believe in what I was doing, I was always drawn to problem solving at work and making processes more efficient, which was always typically done with software and my appointment onto 'business improvement' forums.

I love software development because when you are working on a project you are always making progress in the right direction, you are always learning new things and solving small problems that end up having a large effect.

## <a name="interests">Interests</a>

**Cycling** : I have always been a keen cyclist, ideally with a riverside pub lunch stops and an overnight camp next to a river.

**Reading** : I love books on psychology, self improvement, habits and fantasy - and more recently software development.

**Cooking** : My partner is an ex-chef and newly qualified dietician, we usually cook seasonal healthy food in the evenings. She runs a supper-club called 'seasons eatings', which I sometimes get drawn into helping at.

**Countryside** : I love nothing more than swimming in the sea after a ride/walk and a BBQ in the forest.

**Altruism** : I am a strong advocate for helping / treating others fairly and spent a year volunteering at a school after work. I also spent an inspiring year working full time at the child and adolescent mental health service supporting therapists look after children in need.
