I am Jeremy, a Makers Software Bootcamp gradate, currently looking for a junior software engineer role.

Please find a hard copy of my CV with some details of my 10 years in property and 5 years in finance attached to this
repository [CV pdf linked here.](https://github.com/JRRS1982/CV/blob/master/JeremySmithResume.pdf)

I am highly organised, **motivated to learn** and to share industry best practice, therefore below I have made public some
of my notes on best practice, various languages and some useful resources within [many nested sub pages in Notion, linked here](https://www.notion.so/Best-Practice-Language-notes-3a8dfb1bec6c49f0987d5dd5a544c18b).

Please find here a selection of the proects that I have worked on while and since graduation from Makers Academy.

 Project Link | Description | Technologies Used
--- | --- | ---
[Vending Machine](https://github.com/JRRS1982/vending_machine)| TDD'd, OOP vending machine tech test which included taking coins from the user, converting to decimal, calculating cost of a selected object that had been added to the machine, calculating change and returning coins with storage for multiple objects and coin values and restocking coins etc | Ruby, Rspec, Simplecov and Pry for debugging.
[Bowling Scorecard](https://github.com/JRRS1982/bowling_scorecard_v2)| TDD'd, OOP tech test with some complex logic calculating scores and frames reaching into other objects with multiple error handling issues, a tricky test of calculation and edge cases being managed | Ruby, RSpec, Simplecov, Pry

[Acebook](https://github.com/JRRS1982/acebook-business-logic)| Probably the best project I have worked on so far. In pairs we worked in an Agile manner for two weeks to create a clone of Facebook, in this Ruby on Rails app we have RESTful routes for users, a comment board and passwords with CRUD for posts and some nice UI styling | Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL.

Each page linked below and its nested sub pages have been created to support my development and evidence what I have
learnt so far to a potential employer by demonstrating those skills and abilities that are commonly required as a
software engineer. They also serve as a personal reflection of what I have learnt so far, to help against imposter
sydrome and assist in setting learning objectives for the future. These titles were recommended by Makers Academy, I
have elaborated on them by adding supporting evidence on Notion via these links.
