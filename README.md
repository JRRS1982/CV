I am a London based self-taught and motivated software engineer, currently developing my technical knowledge and skill
after graduating from the Makers Academy software engineering bootcamp.

I am ***motivated to keep learning*** and love sharing to hold myself accountable and to document industry best practice,
therefore [here](https://www.notion.so/Best-Practice-Language-notes-3a8dfb1bec6c49f0987d5dd5a544c18b) I have made public
 some of my working notes on various languages and some useful resources.

My interest in IT has always been present, I played with circuit boards at sixth form, and went to Farnborough College
in 2001 to learn to code, but my career took another path and I spent 10 years in property followed by five in finance.
While I picked up many transferable skills during this time I did not believe in what I was doing, I was always drawn to
problem solving at work and making processes more efficient, which has always been with software. I love software
development because when you are working on a project you are challenged and tested and are forced to always be learning
new technology and languages, I enjoy this challenge and the variety of problems that it brings.
